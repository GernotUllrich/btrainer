LONG GATHER SHOTS
Gather shot is a point that allows the player to collect the balls in a reduced area called the
"gather shot area". A long gather shot is a shot that uses the entire surface of the table, as
opposed to a width gather shot where the balls remain in the third of the billiard table. The
gather shot zone can be anywhere on the billiard table, but it is when the gather shot zone
is near a cushion or corner that the margin of error increases.
This chapter describes 67 long gather shot diagrams. Each of these typical gather shots can
be declined in an infinite number of different positions, where the location of the balls and
the distances change, but the type of gather shot remains unchanged. Here's an example:

The diagram on the left shows the typical position. There are a multitude of other different
positions, some of which are shown on the right, but in which the gather shot always
remains the same.
Long gather shots are points where accuracy is relative, unlike width gather shots where
the player can be much more accurate due to the shorter distances. The place where the
player ball hits the ball 3, the exact trajectory of the ball 2 and the energy of balls 1 and 2

are elements that are difficult to master perfectly in long gather shots, precisely because
the distances are often important.
The lengthy gather shots outlined in this chapter have very different difficulties. Some are
very easy and therefore often used, while others are particularly difficult. These, even if
they occur during the game, are points that players are reluctant to achieve because of their
degree of difficulty. Even if for this reason the player gives up and chooses another
solution, it is still important to know and work on them because they open up additional
perspectives that can only be useful.
All long gather shots are numbered
and briefly described in the title.

The billiard table, the balls and the
cue are conceptioned to respect the
real proportions. The only element
that is difficult to represent on the
diagram is the impact of the balls
on the bands.

The balls are precisely positioned
on the table. It is necessary to
scrupulously respect their location
to be sure that the position can be
played according to the drawn
trajectories.

The three balls are placed by means
of marker lines. These are the lines
in frame 47/2 and the lines
connecting
the
respective
diamonds.

Sometimes the balls had to be
positioned outside of these marker
lines. Reason why other markers
are used. These are imaginary balls
(drawn with crosses inside) that
allow you to place a ball at a certain
distance from a marker.

The gather shots have been executed a number of times with the parameters that are
described right next to the diagram. But you have to take into account the material that
changes from table to table, from one set of balls to another and from one band to another.

It is therefore possible, depending on the material you are playing on, that the parameters
may not be quite correct and may need to be adapted.
Next to the long gather shot diagram is the description
of the parameters. The first drawing represents balls 1
and 2 and sets the amount of ball, the height of attack
and the effect.
Quantité de bille: 1/4 de bille
Hauteur d’attaque: au centre
Effet: maximum d’effet à gauche

The force is represented by the weight of the cue,
which depends on the position of the hand on the heel
of the cue. Muscle force is not included. The force is
calibrated in four levels: 1 weak, 2 medium, 3 strong
and 4 very strong. Long gather shots are almost all
calibrated between 3 and 4. Forces 1 and 2 are more
for small points, placements and width gather shots.

Speed is represented by the speed of the swinging
movement of the forearm. It is calibrated in four levels:
1 slow, 2 normal, 3 fast, 4 very fast. Slow speed is
normally only used for small points, width gather shots
or placements.

As for the last parameter, energy, it is described by
separating its two components which are force and
speed.

Tail tilt is not included in these parameters since all
these long gather shots are performed with a horizontal
tail.

All parameters are set to help the player in his choices. However, it is obvious that the
force and speed parameters cannot be reduced to only four possibilities each. According to
the same principle, it is logical that the different quantities of balls are far more numerous
than the seven main ones. As for the point of attack, it is schematized as precisely as
possible, but some uncertainty remains. Although every effort has been made to ensure
that these parameters are set and drawn as accurately as possible, a certain margin of error
remains.
Above the diagram is the level of difficulty of the point: easy, medium, difficult. Below
the drawing, at the bottom of the page, there are various useful remarks about the long
gather shot or its parameters.
In addition to the figures described on the following pages, there are many other diagrams.
In addition, each player invents his own gather shot figures by mixing several trajectories
or finding new solutions.

This is one of the four basic gather shots, one of the very first to be learned and worked
on. The amount of rotation obtained by a low attack height and normal speed is more than
enough to achieve the point. As for the force, it is indicated as strong because ball 2 still
has two lengths to go. But in reality, it would be slightly less than 3.

The only difficulty with this point is the touch of the amount of ball. If this is correct, balls
1 and 2 follow each other almost to the corner. However, the player's ball must keep a
slight lead over the ball 2, to avoid the back touch in the gather shot zone.

This is the second of four basic gather shots that you must first learn and work on. The
distance between balls 2 and 3 is still quite large and the backspin requires a low attack
height and a rather fast speed of execution.
The point may become complicated if ball 3 is out of the corner, or if the distance between
balls 1 and 2 or/and 2 and 3 increases.

The point as presented here is rather easy to achieve, even if the distance between balls 1
and 2 is not as appreciable as in a normal draw.
The length of the draw and the measurement of ball 2 are easily controllable. But the draw
becomes very hard when the distance between balls 1 and 2 decreases.

Not much to say about that. Except for maybe two things that are a little more delicate
than the others. First of all the amount of very full ball and the attacking height just above
the center are not always obvious to master. Secondly the wrong collision of the ball 2
after its first rail is avoided if the cue ball goes before the ball 2.

This is the third of four basic gather shots that the beginner must work tirelessly. If it
appears for a confirmed player as being simple, the beginner will have difficulty in
spotting the tricks where this type of gather shot is possible. It is in fact the trajectory of
ball 2 that is difficult to visualize, notably because of its proximity to the long cushion.
The closer the ball 2 is to the rail, the harder the point is for the return of the cue ball to the
ball 3.
